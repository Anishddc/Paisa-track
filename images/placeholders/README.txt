You'll need to add the following images to the project:

1. app-mockup.png - Main app preview image shown in the hero section
2. setup-screenshot.png - Screenshot showing the app setup process
3. tracking-screenshot.png - Screenshot showing expense tracking features
4. reports-screenshot.png - Screenshot showing reports and analytics
5. device-mockups.png - Image showing the app on multiple devices
6. google-play-badge.png - Google Play Store download badge
7. app-store-badge.png - Apple App Store download badge

For the final product, create or obtain appropriate high-quality images.
